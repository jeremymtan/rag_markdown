# kamal lock

Manage deployment locks.

Commands that are unsafe to run concurrently will take a lock while they run. The lock is an atomically created directory in the `.kamal` directory on the primary server.

You can manage them directly â€” for example, clearing a leftover lock from a failed command or preventing deployments during a maintenance window.

```bash
$ kamal lock
Commands:
  kamal lock acquire -m, --message=MESSAGE  # Acquire the deploy lock
  kamal lock help [COMMAND]                 # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
  kamal lock release                        # Release the deploy lock
  kamal lock status                         # Report lock status
```

Example:

```bash
$ kamal lock status
  INFO [f085f083] Running /usr/bin/env mkdir -p .kamal on server1
  INFO [f085f083] Finished in 0.146 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
There is no deploy lock
$ kamal lock acquire -m "Maintenance in progress"
  INFO [d9f63437] Running /usr/bin/env mkdir -p .kamal on server1
  INFO [d9f63437] Finished in 0.138 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
Acquired the deploy lock
$ kamal lock status
  INFO [9315755d] Running /usr/bin/env mkdir -p .kamal on server1
  INFO [9315755d] Finished in 0.130 seconds with exit status 0 (successful).
