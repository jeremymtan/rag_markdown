# kamal rollback

You can rollback a deployment with `kamal rollback`.

If you've discovered a bad deploy, you can quickly rollback to a previous image. You can see what old containers are available for rollback by running `kamal app containers -q`. It'll give you a presentation similar to `kamal app details`, but include all the old containers as well.

```

From the example above, we can see that `e5d9d7c2b898289dfbc5f7f1334140d984eedae4` was the last version, so it's available as a rollback target. We can perform this rollback by running `kamal rollback e5d9d7c2b898289dfbc5f7f1334140d984eedae4`.

That'll stop `6ef8a6a84c525b123c5245345a8483f86d05a123` and then start a new container running the same image as `e5d9d7c2b898289dfbc5f7f1334140d984eedae4`. Nothing needs to be downloaded from the registry.

**Note:** By default, old containers are pruned after 3 days when you run `kamal deploy`.
