# Booting

When deploying to large numbers of hosts, you might prefer not to restart your services on every host at the same time.

Kamalâ€™s default is to boot new containers on all hosts in parallel. However, you can control this with the boot configuration.

## [Fixed group sizes](#fixed-group-sizes)

Here, we boot 2 hosts at a time with a 10-second gap between each group:

```yaml
boot:
  limit: 2
  wait: 10
```

## [Percentage of hosts](#percentage-of-hosts)

Here, we boot 25% of the hosts at a time with a 2-second gap between each group:

```yaml
boot:
  limit: 25%
  wait: 2
```
