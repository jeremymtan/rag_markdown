# SSH configuration

Kamal uses SSH to connect and run commands on your hosts.
By default, it will attempt to connect to the root user on port 22.

If you are using a non-root user, you may need to bootstrap your servers manually before using them with Kamal. On Ubuntu, youâ€™d do:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io curl git
sudo usermod -a -G docker app
```

## [SSH options](#ssh-options)

The options are specified under the ssh key in the configuration file.

```yaml
ssh:
```

## [The SSH user](#the-ssh-user)

Defaults to `root`:

```yaml
  user: app
```

## [The SSH port](#the-ssh-port)

Defaults to 22:

```yaml
  port: "2222"
```

## [Proxy host](#proxy-host)

Specified in the form <host> or <user>@<host>:

```yaml
  proxy: root@proxy-host
```

## [Proxy command](#proxy-command)

A custom proxy command, required for older versions of SSH:

```yaml
  proxy_command: "ssh -W %h:%p user@proxy"
```

## [Log level](#log-level)

Defaults to `fatal`. Set this to `debug` if you are having SSH connection issues.

```yaml
  log_level: debug
```

## [Keys only](#keys-only)

Set to `true` to use only private keys from the `keys` and `key_data` parameters,
even if ssh-agent offers more identities. This option is intended for
situations where ssh-agent offers many different identities or you
need to overwrite all identities and force a single one.

```yaml
  keys_only: false
```

## [Keys](#keys)

An array of file names of private keys to use for public key
and host-based authentication:

```yaml
  keys: [ "~/.ssh/id.pem" ]
```

## [Key data](#key-data)

An array of strings, with each element of the array being
a raw private key in PEM format.

```yaml
  key_data: [ "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----" ]
```

## [Config](#config)

Set to true to load the default OpenSSH config files (~/.ssh/config,
/etc/ssh_config), to false ignore config files, or to a file path
(or array of paths) to load specific configuration. Defaults to true.

```yaml
  config: true
```
