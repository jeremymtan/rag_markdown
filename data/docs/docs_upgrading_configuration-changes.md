# Kamal 2: Configuration changes

## [Builder](#builder)

The [builder configuration](../../configuration/builders) has been simplified.

### Arch

You must specify the architecture(s) you are building for:

```yaml
# single arch
builder:
  arch: amd64

# multi arch
builder:
  arch:
    - amd64
    - arm64
```

### Remote builders

Set the remote directly with the remote option. By default, it will only be used if the arch you are building doesn't match the local machine:

```yaml
builder:
  arch: amd64
  remote: ssh://docker@docker-builder
```

You can force Kamal to only use the remote builder, by setting `local: false`:

```yaml
builder:
  arch: amd64
  local: false
  remote: ssh://docker@docker-builder
```

### Driver

Kamal will now always use the Docker container (link) driver by default. You can set the driver yourself to change this:

```yaml
builder:
  driver: docker
```

The Docker driver has limited capabilities — it doesn't support build caching or multiarch images.

## [Traefik &rarr; Proxy](#traefik-to-proxy)

The `traefik` configuration is no longer valid. Instead, you can configure kamal-proxy under [proxy](../../configuration/proxy).

If you were using custom Traefik labels or args, see the proxy configuration to determine whether you can convert them.

Be aware that by default kamal-proxy forwards traffic to the container port 80, this is because we assume your container is running Thruster, and it listens on the port 80. If you are running a different service or port, you can configure the app_port setting:

```yaml
proxy:
  app_port: 3000
```

kamal-proxy supports common requirements such as buffering, max request/response sizes, and forwarding headers, but it does not encompass the full breadth of everything Traefik can do.

If you don't see something you need, you can raise an issue and we'll look into it, but we don't promise to support everything — you might need to run Traefik or another proxy elsewhere in your stack to achieve what you want.

## [Healthchecks](#healthchecks)

The healthcheck section has been removed.

### Proxy roles

For roles running with a proxy, the healthchecks are performed externally by kamal-proxy, not via internal Docker healthchecks. You can configure them under [proxy/healthcheck](../../configuration/proxy#healthcheck).

```yaml
proxy:
  healthcheck:
    path: /health
    interval: 2
    timeout: 2
```

Please note that the healthchecks will use the `app_port` setting, which defaults to port 80. Previously, healthchecks defaulted to port 3000. You can change this back with:

```yaml
proxy:
  app_port: 3000
```

### Non-proxy roles

For roles that do not run the proxy, you can set a custom Docker healthcheck via the [options](../../configuration/roles#custom-role-configuration).

```yaml
servers:
  web:
    ...
  jobs:
    options:
      health-cmd: bin/jobs-healthy
```

For those containers, Kamal will wait for the `healthy` status if they have a healthcheck or `running` if they don't.

You can set a `readiness_delay`, which is used when we see the `running` status. We'll wait that long and confirm the container is still running before continuing.

### All roles

There are two timeouts you can set at the root of the config that are used across all roles, whether they use a proxy or not.

```yaml
# how long to wait for new containers to boot
deploy_timeout: 20

# how long to wait for requests to complete before stopping old containers
# Replaces stop_wait_time
drain_timeout: 20

# how long to wait for 'non-proxy role' containers without healthchecks to stay in the running state
readiness_delay: 10
```
