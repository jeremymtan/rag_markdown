# Kamal 2: Continuing to use Traefik

Kamal 2 requires kamal-proxy, but it's possible to continue to use Traefik if required.

You can run it as a Kamal accessory, and route requests through it and then on to kamal-proxy.

## Set the kamal-proxy boot config

We'll need to change kamal-proxy's default boot config so that:

1. It doesn't publish ports on the host.
2. It adds the labels Traefik needs to route requests to it.

Add a [pre-deploy hook](../../hooks/pre-deploy) for Traefik to pick up:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
kamal proxy boot_config set \
  --publish false \
  --docker_options label=traefik.http.services.kamal_proxy.loadbalancer.server.scheme=http \
                   label=traefik.http.routers.kamal_proxy.rule=PathPrefix\(\`/\`\)
```

You can add the `kamal proxy boot_config set` command to a [pre-deploy hook](../../hooks/pre-deploy). This will ensure that it is set correctly when deploying to a host for the first time.

## Create the accessory

Add Traefik as an accessory to `config/deploy.yml`, binding to the host port.

```yaml
accessories:
  traefik:
    service: traefik
    image: traefik:v2.10
    port: 80
    cmd: "--providers.docker"
    options:
      volume:
        - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
    roles:
      - web
```

## Running with Traefik

When you call `kamal setup`, it will boot the Traefik accessory, call the pre-deploy hook to update kamal-proxy's boot config, and then boot kamal-proxy and the app.

Requests will flow from Traefik to kamal-proxy to your app.

```

## Switching on a host already running kamal-proxy

If you are already running kamal-proxy, you'll need to:

1. Manually run the `kamal proxy boot_config set` command from the deploy hook.
2. Run `kamal proxy reboot` to pick up those boot config changes.
3. Run `kamal accessory boot traefik` to start Traefik.
