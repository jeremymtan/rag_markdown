# 37signals Code of Conduct

We expect all active 37signals employees and contractors to:

* Assume good intentions. Approach work relationships defaulting to trust and positivity.
* Work "in the open" and be open to teaching and learning from others.
* Be respectful and empathetic, especially when it comes to differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism and direct feedback, and offer feedback in the same spirit.

We expect 37signals to be a healthy place for all staff. 37signals prohibits all forms of discrimination and harassment.

If you experience or witness something that violates our Code of Conduct, please report it to your manager or to your People Ops team via email or chat. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and your confidentiality will be as protected as possible during the investigation.

If an employee is found to have violated our Code of Conduct, it will be permanently documented in their personnel file. Depending on the severity of the offense and the findings of the investigation, additional responses may include mandatory training, a formal reprimand, or termination. The reactive measures taken will be shared with the reporting employee when possible.

In extreme circumstances, you can [report an incident anonymously](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4177996672). Anonymous complaints should be reserved for incidents in which you fear for your safety.

37signals prohibits retaliation against any 37signals employee who participates in a Code of Conduct report or investigation. If you believe you are being retaliated against, please contact the People Ops team.

*An important note*: Most interpersonal conflicts do not rise to the level of a Code of Conduct report. If you find a colleague rude or difficult to work with, you should address that with your manager or better yet with that colleague directly. Code of Conduct reports are reserved for serious transgressions — illegal or egregiously unethical behavior.

## Politics at work

We respect everyone’s right to participate in political expression and activism, but we avoid having political debates on our internal communication systems. 37signals as a company also does not weigh in on politics publicly, outside of topics directly related to our business. You should be at peace with both of these stances.
